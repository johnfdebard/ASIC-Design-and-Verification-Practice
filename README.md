# ASIC-Design-and-Verification-Practice
This project shall be used for Wasim and John to test and verify each others code to aid for us to get a job at NVIDA where one of us will be a design engineer and one of us will be a verification engineer.  But not both.

The structure of the project is going to be as follows, each of the projects are going to follow the exact structure:

```bash
.
├── ...
├── Project1                   # Name of the task (e.g. ALU, FIFO, etc)
│   ├── John                   # Designer/Verification Engineer
│   |   ├── Design
|   |   ├── Verification       
│   └── Wasim                  # Designer/Verification Engineer
|       ├── Design
|       ├── Verification       # Designer/Verification Engineer
├── Project2                   # Name of the task (e.g. ALU, FIFO, etc)
└── ...
```

For running the projects, the design and verification engineer can use whatever tool they want to design their rtl and their testbenches, but the running instructutions must be consistent with all of the projects and is contained in their projects.
